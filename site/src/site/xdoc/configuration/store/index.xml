            stored in a blob in the database</li>
        <li><a href="VFSStore.html">VFS Store (Virtual File System)</a><br/>the
            content is stored with the

            </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="Common Store Properties at a Type">
      <p>Some store properties are common and used from all store type
